## This is the beginning

A little about myself.  I have always been interested in web development.  I made several attempts in the past to learn on my own, utlizing free resources, mostly learning HTML, CSS and Javascript/JQuery.  I ended picking up bits and pieces of knowledge, maybe enough to create a simple static website, but not anything functional.  Upon more research, I realized that I was more interested in the backend of things.  I was never a great designer, any representation was done through stick figure drawings.  Heck I probably could not even draw a straight line in Photoshop, and there is a tool for that!

Anyway, I recently decided to make a serious effort to change my career, and become a Web Developer.  Choosing what to learn was probably the hardest part, there is an abundance of resources available online, but I was greatly lacking in direction.  Joining a full-time coding bootcamp was very interesting, but currently do not have the time (or money) to do so.  An online bootcamp seemed to be my best option.  There were also several options in this category, but I chose Tealeaf Academy, where I am currently enrolled.

This blog was created as part of my coursework at Tealeaf Academy.  At the time of this posting, I am just about to finish the first course.  I  have learned so much over the past month, it is hard to put into words.  Hopefully this blog will help me document the details a little better.

Anyway, this was just to get my site started, I still need to put together more content and remind myself to post here every once in a while.

Until next time.
