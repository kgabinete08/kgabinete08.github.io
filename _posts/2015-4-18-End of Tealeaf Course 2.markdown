### Just finished Course 2 at Tealeaf Academy ###

At the end of course 2 we were asked to build our own app using what we have learned so far.  I ended up building a simple meal planner app, where users can add recipes then build meal plans using those recipes.  Users can also vote and comment on the recipes.

I am really pleased with my progress so far, 3 months ago I had no idea where to start with this endeavour, now I can build web applications.  I am about to start Course 3 at Tealeaf Academy, this is their level up to professional level course and they let you know it is going to be hard.  Looking forward to it.

Here are the projects that I have deployed so far.
