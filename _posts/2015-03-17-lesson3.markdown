So for course 2 at Tealeaf Academy, our main app is called Postit, which is basically a clone of the site Reddit.  We are building this using Ruby on Rails.  After lesson 3, the app has been deployed to Heroku and it has enough features to make it feel like a full web application.  We have implemented user registration, logged in user can create posts, comment on posts and voting as well through polymorphic association.

### Polymorphic Association ###

{% highlight ruby %}
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :photos
  has_many :videos
  has_many :likes
end

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :likes, as: :likeable # => polymorpic
end

class Video < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  has_many :likes, as: :likeable # => polymorphic
end

class Like < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :user
  belongs_to :likeable, polymorphic: true # => polymorphic
end

{% endhighlight linenos %}

The code above sets the polymorphic association between `Likes` and model objects (`Photo`, `Video`).  On the database side for likes, we need columns for the `user_id`, `likeable_type` and `likeable_id`.
